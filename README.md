# it355-spring-mvc-master
<h3>A second year university Spring MVC project:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Made for the IT355 Web Services II course</li>
  <li>Has a MySQL database</li>
  <li>All app view snapshots are collected in the <b>screen-shots</b> dir</li>
  <li>The web app is created for an imaginary telephone sales company</li>
  <li>Comments, variables, services, functions and components are written in mixed serbian/english</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project boot:</h3>
<p>The development IDE is IntelliJ IDEA. In order to deploy this app to localhost,
you'll need to start a Tomcat (TomEE) Server which will push the app to your
chosen browser. I've also added a sql file that you can use in your database manager to create and 
insert a couple of rows of info.</p>
<h3>A short personal note:</h3>
<p>I'm not really interested in the Java Spring Framework, but it helped me understand REST services,
HTTP requests, web components development, database and security configurations. Woo woo!</p>
<p>This is the landing page. Check out more snapshots in the mentioned folder above.</p>
