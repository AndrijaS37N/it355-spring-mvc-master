# IT355 Spring MVC Master
<h3>A simple, second year university Spring MVC project.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Made for the <b>IT355 Web Services II</b> course.</li>
  <li>Has a MySQL database.</li>
  <li>All app view snapshots are collected in the <b>snapshots</b> dir.</li>
  <li>The web app is created for an imaginary telephone sales company.</li>
  <li>Comments, variables, services, functions and components are written in mixed serbian/english.</li>
  <li>Has a shallow, test only front end.</li>
  <li>A later date log: <b>There are several security vulnerabilities regarding Spring dependencies. This is not amended however, as this project is not maintained.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional project information.</h3>
<p>The development IDE is IntelliJ IDEA. In order to deploy this app to localhost,
you'll need to start a Tomcat (TomEE) Server which will push the app to your
chosen browser. I've also added a sql file that you can use in your database manager to create and 
insert a couple of rows of info.<b>Spring framework is huge from what I've gathered.</b></p>
<h3>A short personal note.</h3>
